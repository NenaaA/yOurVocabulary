#yOur Vocabulary

The best way to learn a new language is to read literature in that language to expand the vocabulary. But if it is a traditional book an individual may get stuck on a word that they don’t understand and that may cause difficulties understanding entire sentences.So we created a website where anyone can read short stories in varieties of other languages and if they don’t know a translation of a word there is a possibility to translate it in an instance.

##Creating an account
To access the entire assortment of stories all a user needs to do is create an account. 
The process of creating an account is simple. They just need to enter a profilename, email and a password.

##Logging into an account
After creating an account all they have to do is log in with their email and password and they will have access to all stories in the “Stories” tab.

##Reading a Story
To read a story from the selection, a user has to press the button “read” of their selected story and it will open it. If a user is unfamiliar with a word, if they hover over it a translation will appear. 

##Applying to become a creator
If someone is a regular user, but they want to add stories of their own they can apply to be a creator. To do this they need to go to the Setting tab for their personal account and press the button “Become a Creator”. After that they will have to say something about themselves to express why they would be a good creator. After they are done, they have to click the button to send their application to the administrators for it to be reviewed.

##Adding new stories
If someone is in the role Creator, they have the option to create new stories for users to read. In the stories tab there is a button that says “Create new” where creators can enter the details of the new story. After they enter the details they have to click “Create” and a new story will be added to the library.

##Accepting creator applications
If someone has the role Administrator they have the ability to accept or decline applications from users. If they go to the “Admins” tab they will get a list of all users and their assigned roles. If a user has sent an application to become a creator, they can click on the option to view what the user has said about becoming a creator. If an admin likes the application they can change the role of the user. If not, they can select the option to decline the application.

##Deleting an account
If the user does not want to have their account anymore there is an option to delete their account in the user setting tab. When the option “delete account” is selected, it will bring the user to a new page where they'll be asked to confirm the action. If they confirm their account will be deleted. Otherwise the account will not be deleted.
